# You need to install Mobile Threat Defense on your Android device

Before you can access your work, your IT administrator needs you to install the Mobile Threat Defense app, which helps to protect your device by finding potential security threats. You might see different prompts on your device, depending on how your IT admin set up Mobile Threat Defense.

* [Lookout for Work](you-are-prompted-to-install-lookout-for-work-android.md)
* [Skycure](you-are-prompted-to-install-skycure-android.md)

**If the installation doesn't work**

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, contact your IT admin. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
