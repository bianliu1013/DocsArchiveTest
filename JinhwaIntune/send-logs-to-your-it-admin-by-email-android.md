# Send logs to your IT admin using email

If you get an error while youâ€™re using the Company Portal app on your Android device, you can help your IT admin troubleshoot the problem by sending them information through email. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_.

> [!Note]
> To make it easier for your IT admin to figure out the issue, you should turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging includes all relevant details in the report. Find out how to [turn on verbose logging here](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).

To send logs to your IT admin using email:

1.  Open the Company Portal app.

2.  Tap **Menu** >  **Help and Feedback**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3.  Under **Help**, tap **Get Help**.

Still need help? Contact your IT admin. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
