**What you need to do:**

1.	If you see the following prompt, tap **Install** to allow Lookout for Work to be installed on your device.

**If the installation doesn't work**

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
