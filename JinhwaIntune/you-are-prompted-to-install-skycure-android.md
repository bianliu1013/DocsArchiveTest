# You need to install Skycure on your Android device

Before you can access your work, your IT admin needs you to install the Skycure app, which helps to protect your device by finding potential security threats.

If you have trouble with the installation, try the troublshooting steps at the end of this topic.

**What you need to do:**

1. Drag down from the top of the screen to open the Notifications bar, and then tap **Required application – Install Skycure from Play Store**. You can also find this inside of the Company Portal app under __Compliance Details__.

  ![The compliance details page on an Android device. The device is not in compliance, with a message at the bottom of the Company Portal page that says the device doesn't meet the mobile risk policy, and that Skycure must be opened to resolve the issue.](./media/skycure-resolves-compliance-android.png)

2. You are taken to the Skycure installation page in the Play Store. Install Skycure, and then tap **ACCEPT** to let Skycure access your device.

3. Open Skycure, and then tap **VERIFY**.

4. Tap **Sign in with Azure Active Directory**, and then enter the account that you use to access work or school email and files.

5. Select the account that you use to access work or school email and files, and then tap **ADD ACCOUNT**.

6. Tap **Accept** to give Skycure permission to sign you in and read your profile.

7. Review the items about how Skycure protects your device, and then tap **OK**. Skycure will take a few moments to set up, then will begin to check for security threats on your device.

  Skycure starts to check right away for security threats on your device.

  If Skycure finds a security threat on your device, you will see instructions about how to fix the issue.

  If no threats are found, all three threat types will appear green.

	The **Device Details** screen in the Company Portal shows that you are now in compliance with your company’s security requirements.

**If the installation doesn't work**

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, try installing Skycure [manually from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skycure.skycure).

Still need help? Contact your IT admin. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
