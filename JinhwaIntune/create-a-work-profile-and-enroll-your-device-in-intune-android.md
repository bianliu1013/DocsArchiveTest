# Create a work profile and enroll your device in Intune

Enrolling your Android device gives you access to company email, apps, and other work data. As part of enrollment, you set up a work profile, which separates the personal data on your device from your work data. Your IT admin can manage only the work profile, which contains your work data. Your IT admin cannot manage the personal data on your device. Find out more about [what happens when you create a work profile](what-happens-when-you-create-a-work-profile-android.md).

To create a work profile:

1.  On the Android Company Portal **Welcome** screen, tap **Sign in**, and then sign in with your work or school account. If you haven't installed the free app yet, download and install it from [Google Play](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal).

2. On the **Company Access Setup** screen, tap **BEGIN**.

3.  On the **Why create a work profile?** screen, read about what you'll be able to do, and then tap **CONTINUE**.

4.  Review a list of what your IT administrator can and can't see on your device, and tap **CONTINUE**.

	You'll see a couple of messages that say "Setting up your work profile" and "Enrolling your device."

10. On the **Company Access Setup** screen, note that your Work Profile Setup is now complete, and then tap **CONTINUE**.

12. On the **Company Access Setup complete** screen, tap **DONE**. You may have to complete additional steps if your IT admin has added other requirements.
